    I really love how happy I've been ever since I met you, I feel like everything in my life just got better. You fit every criteria of what I consider as a "perfect partner" for me. 
    <br>
    <br>
 	Ngl, I see a lot in you that makes me like you even more. Seems like we do share a little lot in common which is a nice occurence. It's a rarity to meet a girl as beautiful as you are
with your attributes. Two of the other things which make me like you this much is your intelligence (A wife should be educated) followed by your sense of humor.
