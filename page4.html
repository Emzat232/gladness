    <br>
To cut the chase, I want to confess how I feel about you. This one is more than a crush, I feel a real & deep connection between us.
    <br>
 I genuinely love you, Lefa. I gave it some time to see if I'm really in love or it's my mind playing trick and now I'm fully sure that you're the one I want. 
      <br><br>
        <br>
With that being said, I want to ask if you would like the priviledge of officially being my girlfriend. &#9829;
