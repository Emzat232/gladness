    First off, I want to let you know that I really appreciate everything from day one. How you've always been so nice to me, how happy you made me, how you gave me your time when you can, etc.
    <br>
    <br>
  I have to admit, I have not felt that way for quite a while. You found me in my "I don't want anyone near me" era and now you got me scrolling on IG looking for relatable reels to send to you.
